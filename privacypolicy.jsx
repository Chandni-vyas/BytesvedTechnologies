              bytesved.com strives to provide an interactive and personalised
              experience to its visitors.
              <br></br>
              We may use personally identifiable information (such as your name
              and email address) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We
              hate spam as much as you do and we will never sell, barter, or
              rent your email address to any unauthorised third party. Like many
              other Web sites, bytesved.com uses log files. The information
              inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
              type of browser, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp,
              referring/exit pages, and number of clicks to analyse trends,
              administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and
              gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such
              information are not linked to any information that is personally
              identifiable.
              <br></br>
              As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information
              through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to
              provide us with information, for example by setting your browser
              to refuse to accept cookies, but this may result in being unable
              to access certain portions of the site or you may be asked to
              re-enter your user name and password.

              bytesved.com uses Google Analytics to allow us to see how people
              are interacting with our apps. For example, we can see that a
              certain recipe is really popular, or that one is rarely viewed.
              This allows us to improve the kind of recipes we provide. The
              important thing to note here is that no personally identifiable
              information (including, but not limited to: name, email address or
              unique device ID) is transferred to Google. You can view Google’s
              privacy policy which explains how they use your data. We also give
              people the option of opting out of Google Analytics inside the
              about page of our apps.
